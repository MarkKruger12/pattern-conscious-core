A new computing paradigm: Pattern Consciousness. Moving beyond data processing to meaningful pattern recognition. I-Ching mathematics meets modern AI.
# Pattern Consciousness Core

> *Seeing patterns, not just processing data*

## 🌌 What Is This?

Pattern Consciousness is a new computing paradigm that shifts from **data processing** to **meaningful pattern recognition**. Instead of asking "what data matches?", we ask "what patterns are meaningful here?"

This repository implements the core engine for pattern-conscious systems, drawing from:
- **3,000 years** of I-Ching pattern mathematics
- **Modern** AI and complex systems research
- **Future** Starfleet-inspired technological vision

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
# Install
pip install pattern-conscious

# Basic usage
from pattern_conscious import PatternCore

core = PatternCore()
context = {
    'time': 'morning',
    'situation': 'decision_point',
    'question': 'What pattern is emerging?'
}

hexagram = core.recognize(context)
transformations = core.predict_transformations(hexagram)
print(f"Pattern: {hexagram}")
print(f"Natural evolution: {transformations}")
